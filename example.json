Extracting juice from fruits like Grapes, Apple, Watermelon and Orange is not at all cumbersome anymore. Moreover, due to its centrifugal force technology, the process time has been significantly reduced as compared to other conventional/mechanical juicers. You can get 2L of 100% fresh juice in few seconds. Find the attached photos of Watermelon, Malta & Grapes juices for your reference.If you don't have the budget for Cold-Pressed juicers, then Philips HR 1863 is the best possible option for you!Overall, It's a great product by Philips. However, I feel there is still some scope to reduce the cleaning time.",

First two days it worked amazing.But on Third day its lower part got stuck n glued on its own, we had to call the technician to get it removed. He took that out with the help of a screw driver after many attempts. He was also shocked to see n unable to give any reason for it.Second, it made very sharp deafening noise while juicing like it's churning some metals.Third, that day onwards juice started remains in the pulp.We returned the product on fourth day in great disappointment.",

                "Review": "We have been using the Juicer for hardly 2 minutes to take out Kakadi (vegetable) juice for daily consumption. But on 3 ocassions due to motor heating the sides were getting stuck - acrylic to acrylic. The juice was also coming out from the sides, maybe because the container was stuck. On the 3rd occasion when we could not free the container for cleaning, it was taken to the Philips service centre in Panjim and with great difficulty he freed the container and gave me the juicer.Posting pictures of where the sides were stuck (you can see the black pieces stuck to the side of the container) and a crack developed while freeing the sides by the Service centre.  I am taking the juicer back to the Philips centre for replacement and correction.",

                "Review": "We purchased in a hope it'd be better than others. First two days it worked amazing.But on Third day its lower part got stuck n glued on its own, we had to call the technician to get it removed. He took that out with the help of a screw driver after many attempts. He was also shocked to see n unable to give any reason for it.Second, it made very sharp deafening noise while juicing like it's churning some metals.Third, that day onwards juice started remains in the pulp.We returned the product on fourth day in great disappointment.",

                "Review": "We have been using the Juicer for hardly 2 minutes to take out Kakadi (vegetable) juice for daily consumption. But on 3 ocassions due to motor heating the sides were getting stuck - acrylic to acrylic. The juice was also coming out from the sides, maybe because the container was stuck. On the 3rd occasion when we could not free the container for cleaning, it was taken to the Philips service centre in Panjim and with great difficulty he freed the container and gave me the juicer.Posting pictures of where the sides were stuck (you can see the black pieces stuck to the side of the container) and a crack developed while freeing the sides by the Service centre.  I am taking the juicer back to the Philips centre for replacement and correction.",

That's y I uploaded a video to let ppl aware of this brand. Best part of the product is the seive of this grinder, it's a soft round plate of tiny holes, so tiny that only liquid can pass through. And it's very easy to clean, like you're washing a steel bowl or glass. Will update my review soon when I'll wash it. Watch video and see for yourself!",

Easy to assemble, clean and use. Also you don't need to fine chop the fruits or remove seeds. It takes care of that.If you want a juicer that extracts entire juice from the fruit, then you should research about slow juicers. They're costlier and aren't quick like this one. But will give you your money's worth. This is meant for everyday household use and provides best result from juicy fruits.",

Very poor quality plastic, but if you are impressed with look it's only you will find it very soon very poor quality plastic, and also as claimed cleaning is not finished in 1 minute, just look wise good product,, not for even daily use , pulp collection jar got stick to motor within few usage, got it replaced by service center, still after one use again due to poor quality of plastic the pulp container became welded to the bottom motor section and I m not able to clean it properly . I am using it from last  5 month 1 time everyday but hopeless product from Philips. Performance is not good, makes too much noise.  issue i found is when you put full lemon/gooseberry without seed or leafy vegetables it makes harsh sound. Also if you press the vegetables with little more pressure, fibre collecting tray get stick with the base and we need to force remove it. Takling to service centre they collect the faulty product and promised to refund the money back but Its 2 months no progress so far, money gone as well as the product gone. Very disappointed with poor Chinese quality plastic product. Do not buy this costly product, service center promise to refund the amount after 2 months of rigorous followups but my money has still not refunded even the service center technician already collected the faulty product. Please don't buy just by looks. Poor quality Chinese manufactured plastic",

But residue pulp quantity is too much of waste and still holds juice as does not come out completely dry. Cleaning too is tedious as there are too many parts to dissemble & wash contrary to what it claims. Though it looks compact, technically I do not see much improvement compared to the old models by Brown or other old models of Philips.",

So it\u2019s not dry and hence some juice is wasted.2) the juicer leaks from each fitting which again should not be the case.3) and even the replacement juicer has a funny smell when used like rubber burning.! So I\u2019m not sure what to do.4) also cleaning is not as simple and easy as they make it sound in the videos.. practically you have to remove every part and wash it with soup.Overall I think amazon either is selling faulty second hand Philips juicers or the product itself is of terrible quality.",

For 5 medium beets it can extract only a medium cup of juice. May be a juicer attachment of mixer grinders perform better where we can add a bit of water too. Only useful if you don't care of the wastage and you have to juice large quantities. Not practical for smaller quantities.",

Instead of drinking packaged juice filled with sugar and artificial flavors it is a good one time investment for juice lovers. It has a powerful motor and thus taking out juice of any fruit or vegetables a very easy job. Cleaning it after taking out juice is bit cumbersome process. I have mainly used it for taking out beetroot, watermelon, carrot juice. One good thing about this is that it separate out seeds from juice. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who loves drinking healthy juice even thought it's little bit costly.",

But after watching video on youtube, I found it easy to use it. As per me, a special thing about the product is, it makes fruits, vegetables and even hard vegetables like carrot, beet juices in a seconds. Cleaning is also very easy and less time consuming.  I feel, Its really a nice product  in India with a reasonable price and advance technology.  Happy with the product.",

I know its temporary but still, its worth it for a while.Close your eyes and buy this and thank yourself later. Never! Let life happen to you.",

                "Review": "Made in China product. But it's a superb juicer. The pulp (especially for hard veggies such as carrot) is almost dry and powdery. Way too fast.It keeps the fibre so the juice is thick but way too bright with natural colors. You won't get such a color or taste in the juice served in shops or extracted using cheap juicers. Even a small glass of juice with fibre feels filling.I did extensive comparison with Slow Juicers with more than double the price. Slow juicers are good for leafy veggies such as spinach. Not good for extracting carrot juice - they recommend to soak carrots for 30 minutes to soften them. Apples get stuck and the juicer is required to stop and clean more often. And there is a marginal difference in juice quality in terms of oxidation as the slow juicers have practically no blade so no temperature - it crushes the veggies and fruits.The Philips one has 800 watts motor but I have never experienced it getting heated. It's so damn easy and fast - even a child with delicate hands can operate it.My kid loves it and keeps asking for juice. So it's a healthy alternative for the kids who don't eat veggies otherwise.Cleaning is not 1 minute but surely doesn't go beyond 2-3 minutes. Plastic is highly durable and of great quality.Service is too good. My juicer stopped working after 20 days (will not go into details but it's mot that juicer is of bad quality - it is not) and Philips technician replaced it with a new unit without even asking for it. Very prompt and satisfying service - i used chat support.Highly recommend.PS: I'm not easy tp please :)",

The juicer wire mess filter will have be removed and again assembled if you want to prepare another glass of juice. Also the build quality is no match to the previous version hr1858. It is unfortunate brands like Philips are also compromising on quality ,even if you are paying a premium for the product.",

It's a good juicer overall but a lot of juice is left behind in the pulp. If you reuse the pulp to re-juice, sometimes the thick pulp feeds into the juice. If you want highest juice extraction, you need a slow juicer.",

Most of type fruit juice easily made in this but only citrus fruit is difficult because seeds are crushed and made bitter in taste. So pls clear all seeds before in citrus fruits.All over performance is excellent .Easy in use and cleaning.",

Now a days flipkart is better than amazon though they are charging 1-2% more on some products. At least they have better CC and policy in place.",

In citrus fruits, even seeds get juiced so better to remove them before juicing. Great product to have at home and make fresh juices.",

It is an extremely easy to use juicer and does its job of extracting juice excellently - with the juicer, it is nowadays easy for us to make sure that the kids are fed in a hygienic way, before going to school and after they return from it too (folks with kids who are fuzzy about eating will definitely appreciate the addition of this juicer to their kitchen ;-)).I am definitely a happy customer!!!",

I make juices with different combinations of vegetables and fruits and keep experimenting. The juicer is powerful and extracts juice within seconds. It is always recommended we have lots of raw vegetables and fruits. But having raw vegetables is very tough and we end up not having them. This juicer is a good replacement for such ideas where you can at least have raw & fresh vegetable juices. Also we get pure juice which does not have water or sugar added.The only minus is the cost of the fruits now a days and some times the pulp makes me feel i am loosing something. But we have to pay for a good health so it is completely ok with me rather than paying for bad health later.",

It extracts complete juice from the fruits and vegetables and the left out is totally dry.Taking out the left-outs is a little problem as we need to dismantle the same and then only the left-outs can be taken out if you need more than 2 litres of juice. For a small family, it is a perfect juicer.",

One can expect 15-25% juice loss depending upon the fruit. Not at all good for leafy vegitables. Cleaning is not just as easy as shown. It normally takes 5-10 mins to properly clean it. Dont spent 1000rs extra  on silver finish at it is not really aluminium as it looks in the picture. Little noisy though manageable.",

Till date i used it for Pineapple and orange only.I think we may lost some content from fruits....it's not extract 100% still i am not sure about it because i have not checked other juicers this is my first one.--Overall i am happy with it.--For cleaning Philips says 1Min but actually it will take little more but it's easy to clean.--One disadvantage of cleaning is that after wash you need to do clean it with cotton cloth other wise you can easily see water dots on the juicer parts.",

The motor starts making weird loud sound when this happens.  To over come this problem I placed a paper/plastic sheet in between these two surfaces so that they do not stick to each other, this seems to have done the trick,",

So decided to go for another one. No doubt this model Philips.Advantage over HR1861 -1. Less wastage.2. More juice.3. Higher capacity.4. Best is low noise though motor capacity is higher.5. We are vegetable Juicer lover and use it 5/7 days minimum.6. Almost every vegei and Juicer including spinach, Cucumber, Beet, Carrot, Mint.7. Value for money compare to very high price of Slow Juicer where price are 3x times.",

I have unpacked the product to realise my long term wish of purchasing this excellent product from Philips. I found HR1864 was nicely packed and I have assembled the juicer within no time. I have extracted vegetables juice using this juicer with so much ease and in lesser time.  The surface of the parts are smooth and there are no corners to trap particles enabling cleaning of the parts easy and just with a normal flow of tap water. The sieve was also made keeping its cleaning in mind. The sieve is very sharp and the one who handles should be very careful. Overall, I found the cleaning of this juicer is much easier as touted (advertised) by Philips. The juicer is more efficient as I got more juice when compared to  that from other juicers. I am delighted with the product & its delivery.",

Poor Service by Philips Consumer Care @philipsindia without attending or resolving the issue WO160-0006043309 has been closed!!Now the smoke comes out of the juicer badly. Watch the Video. DON'T BUY this Product/Model.It is really disappointing, didn't expect Phillips to make such poor quality products!!",

                "Review": "I recently ordered Philips juicer after reading reviews.Here is my experience with it -The juicer is very convenient and gives juice fast! you don't need to cut most of the vegetables and fruits, As the big mouth lets you feed them whole. The cleaning is very convenient, though not as fast as Philips claims. While all parts can be cleaned easily, The one minus is the iron mesh, you will need a toothbrush to clean it, as the fiber from the vegetables will get stuck in it's small holes.You can remove and assemble it really quickly & easily.The other con for this juicer is that it doesn't get all the juice out of the vegetables and fruits. The remaining pulp looked dry, but when I squeezed it with my hands, I got more juice out of it. I guess, one needs to buy a more expensive slow masticating juicer for that.To sum it up,+Ves :1. Very convenient2. Quick juicer3. cleaning is easy4. assembly is easy5. No need to cut up the vegetables and fruits, as it will take them whole with the large mouth.-ves:1. cleaning the wire screen is a bit of a hassle (needs a toothbrush). not too bad though.2. It doesn't squeeze all the juice out of the fruits/vegetables. The pulp still has some juice left in it. (unless you are willing to buy a more expensive masticating juicer around 20k, I think we can live with it)I strongly recommend this juicer, if you are serious about juicing!  Well built, quick and convenient for the modern lifestyle!",

Although I was looking the bigger model HR 1871 for jucing capacity reason but this model HR1863/20 is just fine. My juicing experience has been fun and healthy ! The only challenge i came accross was the pulp holder capacity, if your juicing for 4-5 people you'd have to clean it at least 3 times. Having an external pulp vent would have made this Philips product fantastic. This addition would make this product a design to compete against. Overall my experience using the juicer has been worth the money and it's really been a blessing for my family.",

Rather I say I was tempted considering it is one third of the price of Hurom's, and promising reviews gave hope for a good option if not considerably on par with Hurom's. But all my hopes received setback once I unpack and start with Pomegranate. I used three big Poms and all it extracted was a fourth of 225 ml glass. I know that extracting Pom juice is a tidy task for any juicer, but I was disheartened to see a lot of Pom seeds were left untreated in the collecting vase. I tried it with Beetroot and I found good sized bits of Beets untreated as well in there. I stand hugely disappointed with Philips on this product. You're not world class I understand, but if you can't provide better products atleast price them reasonably as per their standard.PS. The two stars are for Amazon. They never fail to impress you with their promising delivery and customer service.",

Making juice was never so easy. You just wash the fruit, peel it if needed (for fruits like oranges), and put the entire fruit into the feeding tube. No need to cut into smaller pieces unless it's really big. We make more juice now than we did ever before. Cleaning the juicer too is really easy. To top it all, it's absolutely beautiful. It's expensive compared to other options available in the market but it's worth every rupee. I highly recommend this juicer to anyone who likes to have fresh juice.",

I saw smoke and sparks coming out one day and immediately called support - the tech who came was quite embarrassed to see the product die in such a short time - given the usage has been as low as 2-3 times a week and limited to soft citrus fruits.I would return the product to the company if Amazon lets me as I dont think this would last long despite repair.In under 2years, the motor has conked off 4 times while we use it only for orange/lime juices.",

And this juicer is only a little more than a month old. It cannot handle juicing  of even slightly  harder vegetables  like betroot leave alone rinds of watermelon and bottle gourds. Be prepared to handle this nicer with great care and peel rinds of all vegetables and fruit of you want to juice them. This juicer is also not good at juicing leafy vegetables. They just pass through without producing even a few tablespoons of juice. Also can be very noisy.",

Selected this model for the large sized feeding tube. Works well though nothing beats my braun. Its a bit bulky and occupies a lot of space amongst the washed dishes. Parts are delicate. Overall its a good product. Works well with beets carrots apples. Musambi juice without deseeding does not taste bitter.",

I try to buy it in a local store but this certain model is unavailable, i finally found it in croma but tey r selling it for 8,500 rs. Amazon selling it in best price so i bought nd received the next day with retail packing. I normaly juice 3 carrots, half Beetroot. Little celery, pakchoi, zukkini, ginger, fresh turmeric, cauliflower, broccoli and one green apple and ll get 500ml of juice twice daily within a minute without adding water. The motor is super speed. The juice came fresh and thick. I use to squeeze the leftover and gets 100ml, but tats not thick as the first press.This juicer will add beauty to ur kitchen. Cleaning is the only little task, u need to dismantle every part including blade and wash it. Otherthan that its an outstanding machine, u wont regret. If u need fresh juice to stay healthy, go for it....",

Juicer works great.It does not grind seeds and the juice tastes great (not bitter at all).Good for citrus fruits, Green leaves -Parsley, palak etc... overall it's perfect buy for small family and can be used easily on daily basis .Best part is hassle free cleaning- 5 minutes. The only thing that takes little effort is juicer steel mesh. Need good tooth brush and runnning water to get rid of small fibers stuck in the fine holes.I think it would have been great if company could make a small / sturdy bottlebrush that could reach inside the mesh (where the blade plate and mesh joins) . That's the only place I find fruit pulp might stick overtime. no tooth brush reaches that deep inside as the space is too narrow.Overall it's worth buying. gr8 product.  :)",

Bought Kent cold pressed juicer around 10k, which in comparison has much better quality juice output, less noise during operation.This model is cheap, so does the performance. Go for cold pressed juicers either Kent or Panasonic, viva series is a waste.Cons:- Can't run more than 40 seconds(otherwise long run motor will be screwed up)- Loud as hell, sometimes the sound gets even more higher and unbearable. I felt like the product will break and ended up returning it.- Juice is watery as all fiber is gone.. Compared same vegetable and fruit measurement with Kent and Kent gave much more quality juice. Don't understand use of juicing without any thickness.. Kent juice was much better than this.Pros:- Easy to clean- Easy to assemble- Cheap",

                "Review": "The Juicer was unevenly finished at first (had lots of dents and bends on the aluminium housing) near the speed control switch. I returned the product immediately. Amazon was quick to pickup the product back and replaced it with a new one in two days which had no defect. The Juicer works fine and I am satisfied with the product. Assembling the Juicer is easy. It chops fruits and vegetable very fast. All parts of the juicer are thick and strong, It won't break unless dropped with force. It won't have lot of maintenance issues if handled with care. Cleaning is easy compared to other juicers. It does not shake while juicing, the suction cups at the bottom holds the juicer firmly hence you don't have to hold the juicer with all your strength. It's expensive but worth buying as it will give you less maintenance issues I hope....",

                "Review": "If you are looking for a best branded juicer out there, then just go for this. It works like a charm !I think it can crush a diamond too into powder (just kidding).It extracts each and every drop of juice from any fruit, this itself is a drawback in some cases like carrot / pomegranate. Reason being, these fruits has more of pulp and less of juice in them. So, you get pulp (wastage) more than juice from these fruits. In order to get 1 full glass of carrot/pomegranate juice, you may have to take 15-20 carrots and  10-12 pomegranates ! I had to take back carrot pulp and put it back in juice and add water to it to make it glassful :( But note, that its not fault of this juicer, as it does its job of \"Extracting ONLY juice\".Hence, this is most suitable for making juice from fruits like Orange / sweet lime etc that has more juice content in them by nature. I made Orange juice (12 no.'s) that gave 5 glasses of juice and whole family liked it :)But still reducing 1 star just because one of the feature says \"QuickClean technology\", it is definitely not quick or easy clean as it takes good amount of time (10 mins at least) to clean it properly !",

Also easy cleaning technique in ineffective (running juicer with water on its pressing rod does not clean as shown in you tube videos.) Also some pulp may come along with juice.edit: after 2 months of use i found out that some part of plastic over motor and bottom of pulp container is melted and this should be the reason pulp container used get stuck many times.Raised issue with philips, hoping for quick solution from their end. attaching pics for reference.",

It is an excellent product- juice is extracted in a jiffy and so easy to clean.However I would have given it 5 stars if juice was extracted till the last drop - which sadly, is not the case. So if we have the time, we press the residue of the fruit/vegetable with a spoon to extract a few spoons more of the juice.Still, I would highly recommend it for the sheer convenience of using it ( as compared to extracting juice with my food processor).",

A lot of pulp along with a good amount of juice was in the pulp collector. Repeating the process didn't help either. Finally had to resort to taking the juicy pulp leftovers and take out the juice using a strainer/seive. This was the same thing I was doing with my existing mixer grinder.",

                "Review": "I bought this juicer a few months ago. I am extremely satisfied with it. I received the product after a bit of hassle, as there seems to have been a problem with the delivery system in place at that time. I received it two days after it was promised from a very courteous and apologetic delivery person. My temper immediately calmed when he explained the situation.The product itself had a few damages on the box, but I was very happy to see all parts and instruction booklet available.I have used many juicers in the past, but this Phillips viva is the most convenient yet. It makes a few liters of juice in a few mts, with very little preparation on my part. Only the cleaning, washing and cutting of very big vegetables needs to be done. I juice whole cucumbers, lettuce cut into four sections (to fit into the chute), whole radish, white pumpkin, whole carrots, etc in no time. If I have more than 750 ml of juice I need to empty the juice into another container and clean out the strained vegetables in the pulp container easily. I have put spinach into the juicer with good juice output. Sometimes the pulp is wet, in which case I save the pulp till the end and reintroduce it into the juicer to get a few extra milliliter of juice (I guess I am stingy) this is why I have given it four stars.Cleaning, honestly I add water after the juicing is done and then dismantle the machine to thoroughly clean all parts with a sponge and soap and water. It cleans very easily, the strainer of course needs a light scouring under running water, but it cleans so much better than the old juicer I had! No scrubbing and using a bristle brush. No bits of vegetables or fruit stuck in the holes or the sharp parts of the strainer! No need for a toothbrush etc. it's so easy friends!I just love my Phillips Viva juicer and highly recommend it to everyone! I have used the Breville juicer at my daughter's house in the US and of course it gives you more juice and a dryer pulp, but this one is almost as good. It cleans well, gives more juice, looks great in your kitchen,  occupies less space and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg!",

On the first day after one use it would not lock.Phillips are not providing home service for a small appliance and I would not recommend the service provided by their service centre.  They told me when I phoned that I would get a call within 8 working hours which of did not happen. I had a call  after three days and was informed that I would get a call from an engineer in half an hour.  Again this did not materialise.  I phoned again and booked another call and was told that an engineer would phone to book an appointment.  I got another call to say that they did not provide home service.  I was not told anytime when I phoned the service centre.I would not buy another Phillips home appliance again.Rohini ParikhCoonoor",

The Apple pieces were struck in the machine and the blade was not grinding until I had to press  them very hard and it grinded them after 15 sec, Don't think it works this way for others also, May be a defective product,  or the distributor CloudTail has given some used or returned product, didn't expect this kind of quality with such high price for a juicer. Don't recommend it buying. Delivery was good arrived one day earlier than estimated date.",

                "Review": "There are juicers and juicers but this one is very special. These are my comments after first use:-1. Considering the efficiency of the machine it has relatively small footprint.2. It is aesthetically appealing.3. I have used the machine to extract juice from both hard and soft fruits and vegetables. The juicer has efficiently dealt with cabbage, beetroot, citrus fruit (oranges, kinnoos), ginger, apple, coriander leaves, pineapple, carrot, cucumber, karela, pomegranate etc. The fruits and vegetables disappear within seconds.4. The pulp coming out of the machine is fairly dry when compared to other centrifugal juicers. The slow juicers are more efficient in extracting juice and the pulp is more dry but slow juicers are more expensive and you need to cut fruits and veges before feeding them into the juicer, making the process more cumbersome and time consuming.5. Cleaning is fairly easy but removing pulp from the side of the container with fat fingers is slightly challenging. It takes more than a minute (as claimed in Philips adverts) to clean the juicer but you only need running water and no detergent etc.(This comment was made because I made the mistake of not detaching black panel with nozzle from the transparent pulp collector)6. The steel mesh has very fine holes. I notice a few fibers from fruits and veges have got stuck in a couple of holes and no amount of washing has been successful in removing them. This indicates that with regular use one would need to do very detailed cleaning of steel mesh every once in a month.7. I would like to assure those prospective buyers who have misgivings about the capacity of this juicer to deal with leafy veges. I juiced a small bunch of coriander leaves and the juicer effectively dealt with them. The entire kitchen was filled with fragrance of coriander and the resultant juice had distinctive flavour of coriander.8. The value of this juicer comes from the fact that raw fruits and veges can provide you with all the essential nutrients but all such fruits and veges cannot be eaten raw because of indifferent taste and high fiber. The cooked veges do lose some of these nutrients. Therefore, extracting juice is the only solution. Some of the ingredients of these fruits and veges are therapeutic and provide active cure for some of the prevalent health issues. Say goodbye to drugs and medicines with harmful side effects and embrace natural way to healthy living.9. If anyone of you smokes tobacco, give it up and replace it with a glass of juice per day and kill two birds with one stone as I am intending to do. It is good health at no extra cost.10. Finally, although you cannot put any cost on good health, I feel that this juicer can be cheaper. At Rs.10,000/- MRP it is expensive. I have purchased it for Rs.7695/- from AMAZON. Thank you.",

I satisfied with its performance and most of all it saves me from cutting fruits before juicing although you have to remove citrus fruit's skin for obvious reasons.",

                "Review": "Very poor product. I bought directly from the Phillips authorised showroom with little discount. Extracted juice is of good quality in its taste. But the design of the product is very poor. Lots of pulp remains in the discarded portion. Seeds of orange crush during juicing obviously you have some of the juice of seeds as well. Vacuum of the base doesn't work in some occasions and you need to wait and do lots of adjustment to get satisfactory results. Not easy to clean. Take lots of time to clean all the used parts. Reassembling is also cumbersome and user must be very intelligent. I mean house wives will find difficulties in properly arranging all the compartments. Only safety point is that the motor doesn't work till not refitted properly.At the top of it the whole machine is so poorly designed that it doesn't prevent the entry of cockroaches inside the motor compartment. Every kitchen has cockroaches and they not only hide inside but may even be crushed during normal juicing. My machine was damaged by them. I ordered the part costing \u20b9 3500/- but the authorised service centre failed to supply it even in three months.",

                "Review": "WARNING: VIDEO IS NOISY, LOWER YOUR MEDIA VOLUME.I am editing it after few month usage and would like to put a quick comment.. If you buy it..Just REMBEMBER TO UNBOX IT ON CAMERA because the plastic of body is really brittle..make it a habit for all expensive products.. Okay so this juicer sucks last drop out of apple carrot beat etc but when i tried oranges, the pulp was too wet with atleast 25% remaining. Many people in review says re-juice the pulp but seriously after spending a lot it cant do what a hand juicer can do efficiently. Still i am not going to lower the star rating. Its still good and smashes fruits within seconds.More than the product pros and cons i will write some basic points which might help you if you are thinking \" if you really need a juicer at home \"I answered myself yes I need a juicer because I used to buy and consume tropicana juices in bulk quantity. But I realized its still cheaper than making juices at home and finding variety of fruits in reasonable price is not easy in India , atleast in Mumbai.  Consider these points and then decide :1. Good quality 100% juices are available like tropicana , real2. Do you have enough storage space for fruits and vegetables you will keep for juicing. As it will always need big quantities for juicing.3. Do you have time and money to spend on finding good quality fruits and crush them to make a small quantity of juice.4. Even if you are health conscious, you are losing fibres if you are not eating the fruit and of course the taste which comes with bite can never be tasted in a sip.5. It will occupy some space permanently on your kitchen platform . use it or don't use it, it will sit there.6. The juice never looks or tastes good as in pack or what we drink at restaurants.7. Are you really going to use it on daily basis or atleast on weekly basis, no matter how expensive the fruits become ?? If yes then go for it .8. Some juices like, melon, water melon, strawberry you can make using normal mixer.9. I don't want to sound negative and discouraging so let me mention the main benefit of having a juicer is you can never consume 1 kg apples at once but you can certainly crush it into this juicer and drink 2 glasses or whatever juice you get .. All at once. So thats what you cant do without a juicer. Consume more and more vitamins without pulp and fibre. Also you can make juice of some fruit & Veggie skins which normally is impossible to eat & digest by human stomach. For instance watermelon skin which contains blood-building chlorophyll more than the fruit itself.Product Review++Its a good juicer for sure. It sucks the last drops out of the pulp++1.25 to 1.5 kg apples gives you approximately a jar full of juice. Screening the sludge is extra exercise.++Most of the fruits you still need to cut if they are not tiny to roll through the neck.++If you buy this juicer remember you should try to juice fruits and veggies as much as with the skin ON.++The parts made of plastic looks brittle and as people posted picture of broken plastic, I am very disappointed with this . why would Phillips use such material for expensive juicer! Why Phillips why !!++Its easy to clean but still a pain. Especially the meshThanks for reading this far. I hope this will help to make a decision. If you can afford easily, I`d say buy one and make a routine of juicing something every weekend. Despite all the exercise, its a very nice tool to have in the kitchen. Could be a very unique gift to old parents, relatives who are not able to eat & taste everything they used to.",

                "Review": "I bought this as a present for my parents as they are quite fond of juicing.Out of the box, the product looked quite nice. One of the reasons I decided to buy this product, apart from the generally good review of satisfied customers who bought it before me, was the form factor. I really like the sleekness and elegance of the juicer. Some of the more inexpensive ones on the Amazon Marketplace - from Philips, Morphy Richards, Bajaj etc. - were of the more traditional style, which I felt would take up more space on the kitchen countertop, and frankly, don't look as good. Also, I happened to be walking around a D-Mart close to home and saw that the feed tubes of those Philips and Bajaj juicers were much narrower, and one of them also had a peculiar crescent-shaped cross section. You'd have to slice your fruits into smaller slivers to feed them in (which I suppose is not a bad thing, just a little more time consuming). The feed tube on this is much bigger, and can take many fruits whole.The product box had a Made in China label, but so far, I am quite satisfied with the build quality. The motor body housing is aluminum, while the upper detachable parts are thick, transparent plastic. It all feels solid.The juicer has four suction cups that hold the juicer down on the countertop and fix it remarkably well when it is being used, to the point that sometimes it's hard to remove it from the countertop. I didn't want to pull it off everytime I use it, so we placed it on a wooden placemat and just hold the juicer down by hand when juicing. This works better for me, but to each his own.As far as functionality goes, we have tried carrots, bitter gourd (karela), and green guava. It has handled all of them really well. The pulp comes out reasonably dry. While I'm sure you might get a few more drops if you squeeze the pulp for all it's worth, in my opinion the incremental gain it not worth the effort. The pulp is dry enough to be discarded (My father has stored the carrot pulp though, since he has an idea to make some halwa with it!). I noticed it more took more effort with the guava, probably because it was so hard, but the juice came out really nicely. We are planning to try pomegranate tomorrow.Regarding cleaning, I wouldn't say that it is a 1-minute cleaning job. All in all, the number of parts that can be removed - and should be cleaned after every use - are 5 pieces. Most of them can be simply rinsed under running water and come clean easily, but the stainless steel sieve requires some light scrubbing. The mesh of the sieve is quite fine and plant fibres with get stuck in it. A light scrubbing with some scotch brite is sufficient. So even though it does take maybe 4-5 minutes to thoroughly clean everything, the increased cleaning time is not really a deal breaker for me.All in all, I am very pleased with this product. I and would definitely recommend it.",

Performance was good but after two years the motor stopped working and service centre quoted a price almost equal to the cost of a new juicer  to replace the motor.  Hence go for a juicer which has a warranty cover of atleast 5 years or go for regular juicer which are relatively cheaper",

One small suggestion is connecting wire length is so short. Increase its length is my suggestion to Philips. Overall a new member is joined in my family. It's not a thing. It's a like member. Nearly from 1month above i watch various brands reviews. I totally confused to buy. Then i watch YouTube reviews also. Finally i order this brilliant juicer. Now my kids will enjoy fruits and vegetables juices with this. No worries about deficiency of vitamins. Thank you for reading my reviews. Have a good day. Bye...",

Though if u r having juice in 5-10 mins you wont feel the bitterness of seeds at all, but if u r keeping the juice for some time on normal temperature or fridge, it will give u bitter flavour of seeds. But fair enough if u r having it right after juicing.I juiced- Bottle gourd, Beetroot, Carrot, Lime, Orange, Apple, Tomato and Cucumber (juices everything so smoothly). Just loved itI have given **** as i feel the fiber remains after juicing are not as dry as it should be. U can easily sqeeze out approx 20 ml of juice from squeezing out the fiber.Other than this one point the product is a must buy.",

Its fast to make juice out of it.2. The size and looks is perfect and would not occupy much space in your kitchen.3. Obviously, you can put the fruits without cutting them and save alot time. I rather prefer to cut the fruits to half in order to make sure its not bad from inside.4. Juice is quite thick and fibrous which I personally love. Because normally we do not get fibre out of the juice as it got strained.Dislike:1. Cleaning is not that easy as mentioned in the advertisement. Especially, taking out the waste from inside. Also cleaning from dry cloth after washing requires time. But still not a big issue.2. Quality would have been little robust. It might break easily if not used with caution.",

                "Review": "In 1 month of usage, it has performed really well.With juicers, one of the integral part is it's setup and cleaning. Entire value should be looked at in terms of setup, use and cleaning. Although most solutions in the market performs well with 'use' part, they failed to become integral part of daily life because of their setup and cleaning overhead.This juicer is a complete package for daily use. Also, best juicers in the market will still leave about 5-10% possible juice behind. On a time vs efficiency matrix, Philips juicer offers great value.People often compare Juicers and blenders. They are two different things and is not a fair comparison.",

We have tried it with oranges, pineapple and carrots. Juice quantity is also satisfactory. The pulp that is thrown out is almost dry, so it looks like juicer has squeezed most of it (though not every drop of it.)",

Not for the soft fruits as lot of juice is getting wasted.",

I purchased it primarily for making ABCTG JUICE,amla beetroot carrot turmeric and ginger. Then the setbacks are that it produces very little juice from beetroot and carrot and the load on the motor while juicing these two makes it go nuts as if it's not meant to juice them!Then i noticed on the second juicing session while making 2-3 glasses that just after 6-7 carrots and a pair of beetroot the pulp container fills very fast then if you continue after that pulp and pieces enters the juice and the vibrations and load on the motor increases tremendously,and by now I have been only able to juice 1 glass! Pathetic!Then in the third season/3rd day while juicing carrots and beetroot,it started giving white smoke from the bottom!And finally on the 3rd day i noticed that the pulp container hat didn't come off from the motor base as it was stuck and that's why it was a frustrating job to clean it. Now I don't know whether I got a faulty product or a cheap one,but thanks to Amazon for a fast refund and in turn I purchased a Braun J300 and this thing is a quality product and now I am 100% satisfied!",

                "Review": "Pros:1. Works well for uncut hard vegetables (beetroot, carrots, etc.)2. Comes with a juice jar that is very handy.3. The legs create a vaccuum so the machine sticks to the surface it is kept on.Cons:1. Useless for pomegranate and other fruit and vegetables. A lot of the juice is wasted. So basically, only good for beetroot and carrots.2. The waste compartment is really small and you have to keep emptying it if you want to keep juicing after 5-6 carrots and one beetroot.3. Cleaning is not as easy as advertised. No matter how diligently you follow instructions, you still see remnants of pulp everywhere, and you end up taking the machine apart and cleaning each piece separately.4. The vaccuum suction thing is annoying when you want to move the juicer. Also, this does not work on wet surfaces.5. Too bloody expensive considering the pros and cons.",

It may be possible for other fruits which has less waste like oranges, sweet lime etc. The earlier model HR1855 was very good which had an option to remove the waste bin from behind if its full.  This model has disadvantage that whole fitting needs to be opened to remove the waste. I am disappointed with this model as i love carrot juice only. However i m big fan of its old model.",

It's better to buy from a retailer. As the courier miscare our products as it is heavy enough and very delicate and poor packing of Philips it gets damaged and cracked very easily. Even my 4th product also damaged. Finally among the fast juicers in the market it is one of the very good product.",

                "Review": "So I've been using this for a bit now. It's a good juicer.PRO:- I've been watching a lot of juicing videos on YouTube where they have to chop the vegetables and then put them one by one, thankfully this doesn't have that. I've put in whole apples and a big fat lauki - juiced well and fit with still space to spare. So yay,CON:- Cleaning is a task. You've got to dismantle it, and remove the pulp, and then put it together it's quite bothersome.- I think the rpm is tooooo fast. But that's personal opinion.- The design could've been more user friendly.- It dances (more on this below)PERSONAL TIP:Like I said, this dances. On turning it on, it moves significantly. So if you switch it on after you've paused it while making juice, it will most probably topple the jar that holds the juice. My tip is to turn it on first and then place the glass under the faucet every time you start it.If this doesn't make sense right now, it will when you do it. But I think it's an okay juicer. Does its job.",

Probably that explains the deep discount.The price seem to be fluctuating more than the Onion price this Sept of 2015. It would have been a good investment, the price went up by 20 % in a fortnight!.You can put a whole apple into the juicer and get the juice.Cleaning - pretty easy and nice. Can be done in less than 5 minutes for sure.I tried this juicer with multiple options - apple, carrots, cucumber, beetroot, pomegranate etc. The experience was mostly good except for Citrus fruits. I suggest the citrus juicer for citrus fruits and not this juicer.I give it a 4.5/5 !!!. If you can afford it, go for it.",

Obviously it will take more than a few minutes it is not as easy as Phillips mention in advertise. But overall look is very good and very compact product for a small kitchen. I am using this product regularly for two to three glass of juice. It works good with hard vegetables and fruits (during this season we used it with beat root, watermelon, carrot, cucumber, bottle gourd, tomato, apple) but not so efficient for spinach/mint or soft fruits.",

                "Review": "It is an awesome juicer from two angles. 1. Easy to operate and you can juice out in seconds. 2. Functional design.Remember this is a centrifugal pump, hence produce heat at 110 degree. Which means the enzymes are killed from the juice. If you are focused on your health then go for manual hydraulic juicers (Which are cold pressed). Those retain 97% of enzymes which are good for your health.",

Pealing and cutting and then taking out seeds was a time taking job and after this blending them is in all a avoidable job.But with Philips juicer I never give a second thought to make a juice. I use it on daily basis and it gives me fresh without any wastage. I just have to peel n put the fruits in it and that's all. That too in a minute. No wastage - fresh - no time - very easy to clean.",

I found that Philips' juicers are excellent and especially this model is The Best in the market. So I bought this. I have been using this for a month and here are some of the awesome features of this juicer:1. It has a premium look.2. It doesn't occupy much space in the kitchen.3. Handling of the juicer is totally hassle-free.4. Any fruit/vegetable juice can be prepared within seconds.5. There is no need to cut the fruits before juicing since the feeding tube is wide enough to hold the entire fruit.6. It extracts maximum juice out of the fruits and vegetables.7. It can be quickly cleaned in just 5 minutes.It's really fun using this juicer and more importantly it's a great investment for a healthy lifestyle.",

But after a week of usage we noticed white smoke coming out from the base. It had a burning smell, and we stopped it immediately and called Philips customer care.Next day their technician called us, saw the machine and said everything is ok. The smoke and acrid smell was coming from burning of carbon which he said is normal during initial usage. He advised us not to run the machine for more than 30 seconds (then give it a rest of 2-3 second and run again). We disagreed with him and told him something is wrong with the motor. But he left saying he will only look into it when the motor stops working, and since motor was still running (even though with smoke) he won't register a complaint.Anyways, the next day more smoke came, and finally the motor stopped working.Now I am waiting for the replacement of the motor. I seriously doubt the build quality of this Philips juicer, and given the fact that we were only juicing  once a day, with just 2 glasses of carrot, spinach and beetroot, I would not recommend this machine to anyone.",

I have been using it on a regular basis and this juicer has become most essential for my daily diet. It juices almost every fruit and vegetables.--------------It is a good juicer for non juicy vegetables. I have been using this for the last five weeks.It is very good for carrot, beetroot etc and leaves a large amount of fiber residue. When I look at that fiber residue It makes me understand what my body would miss.With juicy vegetables and fruits, it produces not so dry remains. My earlier Black and Decker 1 kw centrifugal food processor did a much better job of squeezing.Easy cleaning! It is just a advertizing hoax. You have to clean many parts, as much or more than other juicers.But I do agree it is a great juicer for vegetables like carrot and beetroot. Works well. I like to use it. And I do love this juicer.",

                "Review": "I have been using this product for almost two years and mostly daily. Its excellent for juicing hard vegetables such as carrots, beetroot, bottle gourd etc, even fruits such as apple, pineapple, grapes, watermelon... It isnt the best for leafy  vegetables (they tend to make juice bitter) but I use some for combination green juices such as spinach, celery, cucumber etc.Over all I am happy with the produce, there is very little juice left in the pulp its almost dry for vegetables such as carrots and beets. Cleaning is Ok, I am meticulous so use a toothbrush to clean the filter. Good thing its a metal filter.The only con I see is that at a time you cannot make more than 500ml juice and then you have to clean the pulp out and remake the juice only after cleaning the whole juicer and throwing the pulp out so its great if you are juicing only for a single person at a time. Else would suggest to go for Lequip ejection pulp juicer where you can juice continuously. Also ofcourse since its a centrifugal juicer with high rpm the juice gets oxidized and needs to be consumed immediately. So compared to a slow juicer the nutrient content is low. One needs to decide accordingly.It has a dual lock on sides after securing that in place only the juicer starts (excellent feature), however lately one of my locks came off and now the juicer doesnt start. Since it has a two year warranty, I am trying to exercise that and get it replaced, will update that response too once/if I find a solution.",

Its the biggest manipulation of facts like Maggi 2 min. Noodles.You will have to disassemble the whole machinery, extracting out the blade is little dangerous, because even after much practice, there is a chance of blade perforations scratching your fingers.I prefer to extract the juice, but not the cleaning as it takes atleast 15 mins. to clean the whole machine and assemble it again. I have used it for nearly 2 months & overall I am not at all satisfied with the product as it has design flaws, difficult cleaning and assembling. Better to go with Sujata as it is more durable & you don't have to open every part each and every time. IT JUST LOOKS GREAT ON THE OUTSIDE BUT IT HAS NO CREDIBILITY & FEATURES AS EXPECTED FROM A RENOWNED BRAND LIKE PHILIPS.",

Pulp was rather wet. And i had to manually extract the rest of the juice with a strainer. :(. The juicer is really just a shredder. The juice comes out within a second because of the centrifugal motion, and the pulp just goes down into bottom tray without any extraction or squeezing!!!",

                "Review": "Review is for the model HR1855, but the same applies to HR1863 since the plastic material used in clamps are the same.I had bought Philips Juicer model # HR 1855 on Aug 2015. The juicer is simply fantastic and juices whatever fruits and vegetables you put in. I almost started using it daily and infact got addicted to drinking juices.So why did I rate one start is just because of the pathetic service. The juicer though works great, has a very flimsy plastic material on the sides which holds the entire top portion. The tip of this plastic connecting to the body is very fragile and broke off. Saddest part is these clamps acts as a switch as well, so if its broken your juicer motor will not work.I called up the Philips customer care and logged the complaint and the service guy came home. He had no idea about this juicer and saw it as if he is seeing it for the first time. He spent around 15 minutes just trying to understand how it works. Finally I explained him, showing all the attachments and how it works. He then took the juicer with him to the service center and told he will update me in couple of days.It\u2019s been 3 weeks now and still the problem is not fixed and I did not get any calls from the service center. Each time when I call them, I get a reply that the clamp is ordered and they have not received it still. I really do not know why it takes such a long time to replace just a small plastic clamp and they don\u2019t even bother to call and update me.I hope the service would be much better in the US or other countries. Atleast I could see Philips responding to the reviews in Amazon.com. But in India, the service is horrible and the service person is not technical enough to repair such products. A product worth around 7000 definitely needs better support, that too when its still under warranty (just 3 months of use). If the broken parts are not covered under warranty, they should atleast replace it immediately when they manufacture products with such delicate plastic materials.I would not recommend investing around 7000 in this product which is having the most terrible service I have come across. If you are sure that you will delicately handle it and no problem would ever occur, maybe you can give a try.",

                "Review": "It is a great juicer and satisfies all my juicing needs. I use it juice fruits and vegetables daily morning for my breakfast. I have been using it for the past week and happy with it\u2019s performance. Lot of juice recipes are vailable in internet which I'm currently experimenting with.Pros:- Big chute and can accommodate fruits without the need of cutting them.- No nooks and corners anywhere in juicing chamber. So, it is easy to clean the accessories. It cannot be done in one minute as Philips claim. But it takes only 4 to 5 minutes.- Easy assembling and dis assembling.- Takes up little space considering it\u2019s capacity- Looks good and stylish- I guess it is efficient too because the pulp is usually dry after a juicing session.Eg: It gives me two glass full of juice [400 ml approx] for '2 Apples + 1 Carrot + small ginger piece + small lemon piece + half cucumber'Cons:- Do not dump all fruits at one go in the chute. Instead juice fruits one after another. Because sometimes, you will l have to put extra pressure to get everything juiced if you dump all fruits in the chute at one go which may cause the overstress on motor.- Philips recommend using this juicer only up to maximum of 45 secs continuously before giving it some rest [like 30 secs to a minute]- Seeve tends to collect pulp in it\u2019s micro hole. Normally most of it goes away when you start the juicer and pore water [300-400ml] into the chute. But still there are some left overs which you will have to wash it with a brush atleast once in a week for effective juicing.Noticed few comments where people have complained about hurting their fingers while trying to remove the seeve. The trick is to first remove the juicer spout and then remove the seeve [unlike what they have recommended in the manual] because you will be able to hold the seeve properly before applying little pressure to remove it.",
